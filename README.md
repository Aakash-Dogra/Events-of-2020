# Events-of-2020

2020 has been an year of unfortunate events. We as citizens of the world have endured one of the toughest years in past few decades. The world economy crashed, a new plague spread throughout the world, unfortunate incidents happened across the world and we lost our dear ones during these times. Yet, we sailed through, we managed to survive and we stayed together to become stronger and more connected.
Through this project, I wanted to recap on what went through the year of 2020; a relfection on our dark times. I hope this helps you to have a recap of how things went down in 2020.
